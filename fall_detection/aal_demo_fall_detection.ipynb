    "The objective of this demonstrator is to show how, by means of a semantic representation of the available resources, the weighted state transition logic is able to generate adaptive and personalized paths for the resolution of a detected fall event.<br>\n",

    "With the terminology introduced in our paper, the semantic representation of resources is an example of descriptive intelligence, that is the ability to acquire the awareness of the current status by aggregating and understanding data from different resources. Knowledges of the relevant domains are expressed as inference rules to deduce new information, as an example of predictive intelligence. The adaptive path generation at different time frames is an example of prescriptive intelligence, that is the ability to guide a response based on awareness of the current state and prediction of future states.<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "This demonstration contains four scenarios:\n",
    " - Scenario A demonstrates the generation of paths to solve a fall event at different time frames following the update of the context status. The generated paths are following the workflow specified in Figure 1.\n",
    " - Scenario B demonstrates that when diagnosis information from Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) and relevant clinical knowledge is provided, the system is able to take such information into account and produce more appropriate paths.\n",
    " - Scenario C demonstrates that when there is semantic gap between the provided EHR data and clinical knowledge, the system is not able to well utilize the available information.\n",
    " - Scenario D demonstrates that by introducing terminology mapping to build common semantic, the system is able to well utilize the available information."
